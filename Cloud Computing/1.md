## Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Nutshell of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is an on-demand delivery model for IT services over the internet. It allows businesses and individuals to access computing resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics on a pay-as-you-go basis. The key idea is to provide scalable and elastic IT resources without direct active management by users.

### Enabling Technology
Cloud computing is supported by several enabling technologies:
- **Virtualization:** Allows multiple virtual systems to run on a single physical system.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Structures software as services.
- **Grid Computing:** Combines computer resources from multiple domains.
- **Utility Computing:** Provides computing resources as metered services.
- **Web 2.0 and AJAX:** Enhance interactive web-based applications.
- **Broadband Networks:** Provide fast internet connections.

---

### Historical Development
- 1960s: Concept of "utility computing" introduced.
- 1990s: Virtualization and SaaS (Software as a Service) emerged.
- 2000s: Amazon launched AWS in 2006.
- 2010s: Cloud matured with providers like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
- Present: Integration with AI, ML, IoT, and 5G.
